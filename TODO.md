# Issues encountered

- Wealth Inequality Report - no direct way to get inequality. Need to get it from percentile data.
- Wealt Inequality Report - need to convert currency for EUR to USD.
- Not all countries are same on all databases - there are discrepancies - needs cleaning.
- Air Quality -> Aggregated data for Air quality
- United States is named differently in world map, CRI and happiness report.
